# UmbrellaTop1M
This script is for Cisco Umbrella customers tasked with better understanding their DNS requests. The script retrieves your Top Destinations over the past week and compares it to Umbrella's Top 1 Million Domains, exporting a CSV of the overlap. 

## Roadmap
This is a work in progress. Script finished/tested for Windows, but will be modified/tested to work with other OS for portability.
